For my highschool's [Project Lead The Way Engineering course](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Lead_the_Way), my engineering notebook was a core part of the class. Spending time drawing 1 / 2 point perspective drawings, the notes earlier in the semester was something I could always look back upon. That should've been when I learned taking notes was important...
  
I told myself during college that notebooks were stupid. All my slides and lectures were online, why would I waste money on a notebook I'd never look back upon. One of my many realizations of adulthood is that winging it really only gets you so far. There have been many incidents where I had learned some technical concept for it to be forgotten later. Advent of Code 2023 really humbled my knowledge of data structure and algorithms to the point where I had to re-lookup what breadth-first-search was. I'd classify my current reality as being a really junior software engineer. I'm still learning how to fully utilize my tools and industry standards. Every day I'm still learning concepts which I know I will eventually need something to look back upon. So in the spirit of starting something new
